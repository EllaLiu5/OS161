# OS161
implementing several parts of operating system for OS161 with a final mark 97/100. 

part1: solve a number of synchronisation and locking problems

part2: a software bridge between a set of file-related system calls inside the OS/161 kernel and their implementation within 
the VFS (obviously also inside the kernel). Upon completion, your operating system will be able to run a single application
at user-level and perform some basic file I/O.

part3:  adapt OS/161 to take full advantage of the simulated hardware by implementing management of the MIPS software-managed
Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). You will write the code to manage this TLB. You will also write code to manage system memory.
